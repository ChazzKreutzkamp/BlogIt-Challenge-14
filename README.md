# BlogIt

## Description

Welcome to BlogIt! BlogIt is a simple blogging app, where you can sign up with a username and password, and sign in with said username and password to access your account in the future. You can then Create posts with a title and main body text through your dashboard. In said dashboard you can view your past posts and even edit them through pressing the edit posts button or through clicking the title of the post that you wish to access. The home page displays the posts of all users of the blogging app, and you can click on the post titles to comment on said posts and view the comments of other users that have posted on said posts (however, you can only do this if you are logged it). In addition, you will be logged off automatically after 20 minutes.
